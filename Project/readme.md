# Project - Frontend

## What

Techniques: React

Make a **component**

The component should contain a couple of form elements such as
- date selector
- text box
- radio button
- checkbox
- button
- select box
- textarea
- color picker
- range

Pick one component from the **Ideas** folder or choose your own.

(You can decide how you want the component to look and behave, don't have to make it exactly as the pictures)

## Mark three

Select three candidates, use this document to make you choice:

## Shuffle

Script to randomize the groups to see which group that will pick first:

    ["Group 1","Group 2","Group 3","Group 4","Group 5","Group 6"].sort((a, b) => 0.5 - Math.random())

## Tips

When you know which component to make, start looking at the components we've already done:

- Email
- Movie
- Basic

Ask your teacher if you get stuck!

## Mob programming

Tip, try mob programming
- Driver
- Navigator
- Mob

Note: rotate roles every 15 minutes!

## Presentation

Create a slide (powerpoint or similar).

Present your project in 10 minutes:
- Why did you choose to do this?
- Demonstrates how your component works
- What was challenging?
- What have you learned?
- Show one or two details from the code
